'''Wang Kemin''' ({{zh|t=王克敏|s=王克敏|p= Wáng Kèmǐn }}; [[Wade-Giles]]: Wang K'o-min, May 4, 1879 &amp;ndash; December 25, 1945)  was a leading official in the Chinese republican movement and early [[Beiyang]] government, later noted for his role as in the [[collaborationist]] [[Provisional Government of the Republic of China (1937–1940)|Provisional Government of the Republic of China]] and [[Wang Jingwei regime]] during World War II.

== Biography ==
[[File:Wang Kemin2.jpg|thumb|Wang Kemin during the [[Beiyang government]]|200px]]
Wang was a native of [[Hangzhou]] in [[Zhejiang]] province.  In 1901, he was dispatched by the government of [[Qing Dynasty]] China to [[Japan]], where he studied western economics and accounting from his nominal position as attaché at the Chinese embassy in [[Tokyo]]. After his return to China in 1907, he was appointed to a post under the [[Viceroy of Zhili]] to manage foreign affairs.
After the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]] had been established, he was sent to [[France]] in 1913. On his return, by orders of [[Duan Qirui]] he helped establish the [[Bank of China]], and became its president from July 1917. He served as minister of finance under the [[Beiyang Government]] from December 1917 to March 1918. In December 1918, he was the only representative of the Beiyang Government to attend a meeting with the Nanjing Government in an attempt to reunify China.

He served as Minister of Finance again from July–August 1923 under the premiership of [[Gao Lingwei]]. However, Wang was strongly opposed by the [[Fengtian clique]] led by [[Zhang Zuolin]], and forced to resign his post after only a week. He returned as Minister of Finance with the support of [[Cao Kun]] of the [[Zhili clique]] from November 1923-October 1924. During this time, he also oversaw the operations of a number of other banks, including the [[National Industrial Bank of China|Bank of Tianjin]].

After the success of [[Chiang Kai-shek]]'s [[Northern Expedition (1926–1927)|Northern Expedition]] a warrant for Wang's arrest was issued by the [[Kuomintang]] and he fled to [[Dalian]] in the [[Kwantung Leased Territory]] under Japanese jurisdiction.

In 1931, Wang Kemin returned to Beijing when [[Zhang Xueliang]] took control of [[Hebei]] Province, and took a post in the Peking Finance committee. He became mayor of Tianjin in 1932. In 1935 Wang was in the [[Kuomintang]] Hebei Government and had a post in the Northeast Government Affairs Committee, and the Peking Government Affairs Committee and other important posts. However, he retired to Shanghai in 1935.

After the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] broke out in 1937, the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] quickly overran [[North China]], and the Japanese [[Imperial General Headquarters]] authorized the creation of a collaborationist regime as part of its overall strategy to establish an autonomous buffer zone between China and Japanese-controlled [[Manchukuo]]. This government was based in Beijing, and proclaimed
Wang Kemin accepted the post of President of the [[Provisional Government of the Republic of China (1937–1940)|Provisional Government of the Republic of China]], with its capital in Beijing on December 14, 1937. The government nominally controlled the provinces of [[Hebei]], [[Shandong]], [[Shanxi]], [[Henan]] and [[Jiangsu]]. But its activities were carefully prescribed and overseen by advisors provided by the [[Japanese Northern China Area Army]]. The failure of the Japanese to give any real authority to the Provisional Government discredited it in the eyes of the local inhabitants, and made its existence of only limited propaganda utility to the Japanese authorities.&lt;ref&gt;Black, ''World War Two: A Military History'', page 34&lt;/ref&gt;

The Provisional Government was, along with the [[Reformed Government of the Republic of China]], merged into [[Wang Jingwei]]'s [[Wang Jingwei regime|Nanjing Nationalist Government]] on March 30, 1940, but in practical terms actually remained virtually independent under the name of the &quot;[[North China Political Council]]&quot; ({{lang|zh-Hant|華北政務委員會}}) until the end of the war. Wang Kemin retained power as Chairman of the North China Political Council, as well as becoming Internal Affairs Minister in the Nanjing Nationalist Government.

Wang was arrested by the government of the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]] after the [[surrender of Japan]] and tried for [[treason]]. He committed suicide before the conclusion of his trial on December 25, 1945.
